# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a principle in object-oriented programming that states
that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without causing any
errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

## Why is the LSP Important?

The LSP is important because it ensures that objects can be used interchangeably without causing
errors or unexpected behavior in the program. This helps to ensure that the program is more robust
and reliable.

## How to Implement the LSP

To implement the LSP, subclasses should be designed in a way that they can be used as a substitute
for their parent class. This means that they should implement all the methods and properties of the
parent class in a way that does not change their behavior or expectations.

For example, consider a class that makes the sound of an animal. Any subclass that inherits from this class
should also be able to make the sound of an animal, but with additional properties or methods. However, any code
that uses the parent class should still work correctly when using an instance of the subclass.

## Violation of the LSP

A violation of the LSP can lead to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and test. If a
subclass changes the behavior or expectations of the parent class, then any code that uses the
parent class may not work correctly with the subclass. This can cause errors, bugs, or unexpected
behavior in the program.

## Conclusion

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is an important principle in object-oriented programming
that promotes creating subclasses that can be used as a substitute for their parent class without
causing any errors or unexpected behavior in the program. By implementing the LSP, developers can
create code that is more robust, reliable, and easier to understand, maintain, and test over time.
