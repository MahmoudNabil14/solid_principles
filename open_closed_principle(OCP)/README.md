# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that states that software entities (classes, modules, methods, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed
for modification.

## Why is the OCP Important?

The OCP is important because it helps developers create code that is more maintainable and flexible. By allowing software entities to be extended without modifying the original source code, developers
can create code that is more modular and easier to maintain. This also makes it easier to test the code, as changes to the behavior of an entity can be made without modifying the original source code.

## How to Implement the OCP

To implement the OCP, software entities should be designed to allow for their behavior to be extended without modifying the original source code. This can be done through techniques such as
inheritance, interfaces, and abstractions.

For example, consider a class that performs a specific calculation. Rather than modifying the original source code to change the behavior of the calculation, the class can be designed to allow for the
behavior to be extended through the use of abstractions or interfaces or inheritance. This allows for the behavior of the class to be changed without modifying the original source code.

## Violation of the OCP

A violation of the OCP can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and modify. For example, consider a class that performs a specific calculation. If the calculation needs to be modified due to
changes in requirements, and the existing code needs to be changed to accommodate these modifications, then the OCP has been violated. This violates the principle that software entities should be
closed for modification, and instead forces the developer to modify the original source code.

## Conclusion

The OCP is an important principle in object-oriented programming that promotes creating software entities that are open for extension, but closed for modification. By implementing the OCP, developers
can create code that is more maintainable, testable, and flexible. This can lead to code that is easier to understand, modify, and maintain over time.
